<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h2>Here are something more about me.</h2>
<p>I like mean professor! The one who can destory my GPA!</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I am a BIOE, but I also enjoy MechE and EE...</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I like physics, but I cannot understand physics for most of the times.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>3B1B is my favorite YouTuber</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>BIOE students should not say "I cannot do statics because I am a BIOE". That is a shame because every engineer should be good at physics and math. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I met a lot of good people in my life. They encouraged me to become a better adult. Appreciate that.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I am studying vary hard to be an good engineer! But I never feel tired because I like it. (well, I do feel tired sometimes)<\p>
